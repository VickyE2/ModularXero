--> Cafeteria main screen is ass because i did it💀 so work on that🌚
--> Basically just like make the cafeteria screens look good
--> Cafeteria create account input fields should be Cafeteria name, Password
--> When caf is registered assign a caf id eg. (caf-001) or sum like that
--> Cafeterias should show on student side only when registered
--> Basically the entire ui is trash..( I js realised), look at it and see what you can do
--> Cafeteria doesn't have a screen to scan order receipts from student
--> When stdent login they shouldn't have to pick hostels..That's just dumb
--> Menu screen is ahhh(Wtf was i thinking...I wasn't)
--> I HAVEN'T ADDED MY PROFIT CHARGE #10
--> The current service charge should automatically be added to total amount
--> That's all i can remember for now
